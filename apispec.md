#Summary for /Users/alexgo/code/summarizer/main.py:

The code is a command-line interface (CLI) for processing files or directories and generating summaries of the code. It uses the codellama API to generate the summaries. The main functions are:

* `process_directory`: processes all the files in a directory and generates summaries of important functions and classes.
* `process_file`: processes a single file and generates a summary of important functions and classes.
* `main`: the entry point for the CLI, which parses the command-line arguments and calls the appropriate function to process the input files or directories.

The code also uses several helper functions, such as `is_hidden`, `read_gitignore`, and `is_source_code`, to determine whether a file should be processed and what kind of file it is.
